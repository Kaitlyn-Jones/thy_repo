# Camping Trip Checklist

1. If you are not going to camp in an RV then be sure to bring a **sleeping bag** and a **tent** \(it can get chilly at night).
2. Bring food that cannot spoil, such as bread, jam, peanut butter, and canned foods. I highly reccommend you bring a **can opener** in the case your can doesn't have a pull tab. \(I made the mistake of not bringing one on a camping trip with my friends and our method of opening our canned food was banging it against a rock. But whatever works for you).
3. A **flashlight** and a **lantern** is a necessity. \(you may need it in order to find a bathroom spot, or simply find your tent again. When I went camping, I would have lost my tent if I wasn't holding a flashlight and if I didn't have a lantern in my tent).
4. Whether there be sunshine or clouds in the sky, it is always important to bring **sunscreen**. During my camping trip I got pretty toasty, so be sure to bring enough to apply it multiple times a day.
5. Bring lots of **water** or a **water purifier**. You may need to do a lot of hiking and the weather may require you to need extra. Don't be shy to bring multiple bottles.
6. Bring a decent **knife**. Knifes can be used for multiple purposes such as defending yourself, your food, or for hunting \(you never know the danger that could be around the corner. You might as well be cautious and prepared).
7. Dress comfortably and being an **extra change of clothes** \(It is hard to predict what may befall you on your journey. Being prepared calms the scared).
8. Bring a **portable phone charger**. Phones die quickly in the wild, and even though wifi may be scarce, it is always good to have some sort of device if you need help.
9. **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT**: Be sure to pack a **first aid kit**. Adventure sometimes calls for injury and illness. It is best that you don't put yourself in the position to find out how to help yourself or your companion if say you be injured and in need of a first aid kit.
10. **Matches** are helpful \(especially if you were not a cubscout or girlscout and were not taught how to use natural resources to start a fire). You may need a fire for cooking or warmth.
11. Lastly, bring a **smile** and a **good attitude**. Camping is fun and you should take time to enjoy the beauty of nature surrounding you.

### Happy Camping!
